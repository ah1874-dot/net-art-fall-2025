<h1>My Corner of Encouragement and Rest</h1>

<p class="quote1">Therefore, do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own- Matthew 6:34</p>
<p class="quote2">Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you. Not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your hearts be troubled, neither let them be afraid-John 14:27</p>
<p id="lovely">You will miss out on life when consumed by worries instead of hope!</p>
<p id="answer">Stop being anxious</p>
