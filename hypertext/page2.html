    <h3><em>THE CHARACTER<em></h3>
  <p>She only closed her eyes for a <em>few seconds</em> or was it <em>minutes</em>, all time was lost to her and all awareness of her surroundings was deaf until she opened her eyes unto the startling scene...<br>
    Her first thought was that she missed her train for home. She stood up quickly and looked at the time.<strong>7:50 am.</strong> The same time that she had seen before closing her eyes.<br>
    <em>"I missed my train,"</em>she thought as the red glow of self-resentment settled hot in her throat.
    <ul>
        <li>But how long everything felt</li>
        <li>How <strong>time</strong> has prolong its effect but shorten its <h3>reality</h3></li>
        <li>But that did not startle the woman as much as what her resentment had disguised her from seeing in front of her..</li>
    </ul></p>
