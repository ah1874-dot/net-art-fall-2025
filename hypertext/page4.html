    <h2>REFLECTION?</h2>
  <p>After hours of strenuous effort, tireless pleas for escape, and half-whispered, half-hysterical shouted prayers, she sat down on the cold diamond-shaped tile of the station and began to cry<br>
    She could not remember the last time she cried. She could not remember the last time she settled down in silence with only her thoughts to console her.<br>
    Rest was a luxury ever since she began her new job, a job that paid well, but left little time for reflection. After a day of work, she simply dropped down to sleep, only to get up tired but alert and begin the routine again<br>
    She has been feeling quite numb for a while.
 <ul>
    <li>Human emotion was erased to be a more efficient worker.</li>
    <li>Quality of life sacrificed to gain a new quality of life that she can gain in a few short decades.</li>
    <li>What a life she lived.</li>
    <li>What a life she refused to live.</li>
 </ul>
    The tears began to dry, and her mind slowed. It was still 7:50 am. But time mattered little for her now.<br>
    She leaned against a nearby bench and watched the silence.<br>
    "I can close my eyes for a while", she thought. It's been a while since she did it voluntarily.<br></p>
