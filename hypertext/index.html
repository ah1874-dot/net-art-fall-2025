    <h4>The train station</h4>
  <p>A lonely train station was loud with silence. It was a grand station, paying homage to the artistic prestige of the Gilded Age.<br>
    A surplus of stores and eateries littered that station- convenience stores, bagel shops, pizza parlors, newspaper stands, flower shops, and many other odd and ends establishments..but they were all empty<br>
Not a shout of announcement of an incoming train, not a whisper of reprimand from a frazzled mother to her curious child going near the tracks,<br>
    not an anxious question from a novice traveler, nor a dissatisfied grunt of a businessman over the delay of a train. All was silent in a still death<br>
    A vacant space, a void of eternal quiet, <h2>but wait!!</h2><br></p>
