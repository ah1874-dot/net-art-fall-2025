    <h1>Religion entering the Digital Domain</h1>
    <h2>Curated by Avarae Hyacinthe</h2>
    <p>The relationship between technology and religion has been an ongoing
    discussion since the beginning of the Nuclear Age.
    Although discussion has many times followed the format of religion interpreting technology,
    the rise of social media platforms and the World Wide Web has given a new medium for people to have technology
    interpret religion. How can people who have been raised and nurtured by technology understand religion
    through the scope of digital reality and form. How can discussions of critiquing religion’s 
    impact on the social and political landscape of nations be understood in creative digital media?
    Today, I will present you with three net artworks and exhibitions using technology to unpack religion in relation
    to the modern digital era.</p>

    <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The installation <em>Conversion</em> was created in 2015 by a Russian group of artists, the Recycle Group. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although it takes place in a physical location, it draws inspiration from the current rise of social media<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the lives of many people, classical symbols of iconology and  Catholic rituals are being replaced <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by replacing it with social media representations. It calls into question whether the rise of social media is destroying<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; devotion to a monotheistic religion, or if social media is replacing ritual and devotion the way was aimed toward religion to be now toward itself<br>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shilpa Gupta’s 2003 interactive net art website <em>Blessed Bandwidth</em>. The website begins with a threatening message to choose to be “blessed.”<br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by selecting a religion to be secured from the danger of not selecting. Through a series of selecting their place of worship, clothes that correspond to their<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; religion of choice, options to keep track of their sins, and more, users are going deeper into their faithfulness to their selected “blessings”.<br>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Salisbury Cathedral in the United Kingdom commissioned the coding artist Jayston Haebich in 2016 to create the nativity star<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the work <em>Star of Bethlehem.</em> The work featured a series of colorful lasers intersecting into geometric shapes to create the <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; star that led the magi to Jesus. The art piece demonstrates the platform technology has given artists and institutions to display religious ideals. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Concepts that are considered too otherworldly to understand are therefore presented in a visually engaging way that viewers leave with a deeper an <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; understanding of what draws religious participants to their beliefs.<br>
