    <h1><b>Religion entering the Digital Domain</b></h1>
    <h2>Curated by Avarae Hyacinthe</h2>
    <p>The relationship between technology and religion has been an ongoing
    discussion since the beginning of the Renaissance, when it opened avenues of opposing thoughts and ideas to the doctrine of the Catholic Church.
    Although discussion has many times followed the format of religion interpreting technology,
    the rise of social media platforms and the World Wide Web has given a new medium for people to have technology
    interpret religion. How can people who have been raised and nurtured by technology understand religion
    through the scope of digital reality and form? How can discussions of critiquing religion’s 
    impact on the social and political landscape of nations be understood in creative digital media?
    Today, I will present you with three net artworks and exhibitions using technology to unpack religion in relation
    to the modern digital era.</p>

    <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The installation <em>Conversion</em> was created in 2015 by a Russian group of artists, the Recycle Group. <br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although it takes place in a physical location, it draws inspiration from the current rise of social media<br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the lives of many people, classical symbols of iconology and  Catholic rituals are being replaced <br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by replacing it with social media representations. It calls into question whether the rise of social media is destroying<br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; devotion to a monotheistic religion, or if social media is replacing ritual and devotion the way was <br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; aimed toward religion to be now toward itself<br>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shilpa Gupta’s 2003 interactive net art website <em>Blessed Bandwidth</em>. The website begins with a threatening message to choose to be “blessed.”<br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by selecting a religion to be secured from the danger of not selecting. Through a series of selecting their place of worship, clothes that correspond to their<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; religion of choice, options to keep track of their sins, and more, users are going deeper into their faithfulness to their selected “blessings”.<br>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Bosch's medieval masterpiece, <em>The Garden of Earthly Delights</em>, has been a spellbinding art piece that has bewildered many with its meaning.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The art piece showcases a variety of scenes that describe the depravity of evil in a sinful world.
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The same themes of the pitfuls of evil stay true in our modern era, allowing artists to reinterpret their message in a modern retelling.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This has inspired the following artists: Ton Meijdam, Thom Snels, and Bela Zsimgond, who create an artists' collective named Smack, <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to unpack the theme using contemporary elements of expression. Their work entitled <em>SPECULUM</em> demonstrate the egotism that technology has encouraged <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the modern age, and how the addictive qualities of technology have created a generation of self-absorbed sysophants who desire entertainment regardless of the price.<br>
