<h1>The Ballad of the Harp Weaver</h1>
<h2>By Edna St. Vincent Millay</h2>
<hr>
  <p>“Son,” said my mother,<br>
   When I was knee-high,<br>
“Youve need of clothes to cover you,<br>
   And not a rag have I.<br>
 
“Theres nothing in the house<br>
Nor wool, nor flax, nor a thread to sew,<br>  
Nor shears to cut a cloth with<br>
   Nor thread to take stitches.<br>
 
“Theres nothing in the house<br>
   But a loaf-end of rye,<br>
And a harp with a womans head<br>
   Nobody will buy,”<br>
   And she began to cry.<br>
 
That was in the early fall.<br>
   When came the late fall,<br>
“Son,” she said, “the sight of you<br>  
   Makes your mothers blood crawl,—<br>
 
“Little skinny shoulder-blades<br>
   Sticking through your clothes!<br>
And where youll get a jacket from<br>
   God above knows.<br>
 
“Its lucky for me, lad,<br>
   Your daddys in the ground,<br>
And cant see the way I let<br>
   His son go around!”<br>
   And she made a queer sound.<br>
 
That was in the late fall.<br>
   When the winter came,<br>
Id not a pair of breeches<br>
   Nor a shirt to my name.<br>
 
I couldnt go to school,<br>
   Or out of doors to play.<br>
And all the other little boys<br>
   Passed our way.<br>
 
“Son,” said my mother,<br>
   “Come, climb into my lap,<br>
And Ill chafe your little bones<br>
   While you take a nap.”<br>
 
And, oh, but we were silly<br>
   For half an hour or more,<br>
Me with my long legs<br>
   Dragging on the floor,<br>
 
A-rock-rock-rocking<br>
   To a mother-goose rhyme!<br>
Oh, but we were happy<br>
   For half an hours time!<br>
 
But there was I, a great boy,<br>
   And what would folks say<br>
To hear my mother singing me<br>
   To sleep all day,<br>
   In such a daft way?<br>
That was in the early winter.<br>
   When came the deep winter,<br>
Men say the winter<br>
   Was bad that year;<br>
Fuel was scarce,<br>
   And food was dear.<br>
 
A wind with a wolfs head<br>
   Howled about our door,<br>
And we burned up the chairs<br>
   And sat on the floor.<br>
 
All that was left us<br>
   When the chairs were gone,<br>   
Was a chair we couldnt break,<br>
And the harp with a womans head<br>
Nobody would take,<br>
   For song or pits sake.<br>
 
The night before Christmas<br>
   I lay awake in bed,<br>
   I cried with the cold,<br>
    And I cried with the hunger,<br>
I cried myself to sleep<br> 
   Like a two-year-old.<br>
 
And in the deep night<br>
   As I lay and dreamed,<br>
   I felt my mother rise,<br>
And go to the harp,<br>
   As it softly gleamed.<br>
And stare down upon me<br>
   In the dark, dark room,<br>  
   With love in her eyes.<br>
 
I saw my mother sitting<br>
   On the one good chair,<br>
A light falling on her<br>
   From I couldnt tell where,<br>
 
Looking nineteen,<br>
   And not a day older,<br>
And the harp with a womans head<br>
   Leaned against her shoulder.<br>
 
Her thin fingers, moving<br>
   In the thin, tall strings,<br>
Were weav-weav-weaving<br>
   Wonderful things.<br>
 
Many bright threads,<br>
   And slender threads,<br>
   From where I couldnt see,<br>
Were running through the harp-strings<br>
   Into my mothers knee.<br>
  Rapidly,<br>
   So rapidly,<br>
 
And gold threads whistling<br>
   Through my mothers hand.<br>
I saw the web grow,<br>
   I saw the pattern grow,<br>
   And the pattern expand.<br>
 <ol>
   <li>First a little jacket,</li>
   <li>Then a little pair of breeches,</li>
   <li>Then a little cocked hat,</li>
   <li>Then a little pair of boots,</li>
   <li>Then a little blouse,</li>
   <li>Then a little shirt,</li>
   <li>Then a little pair of mittens,</li>
   <li>Then a red cloak.</li>

She wove a childs jacket,<br>
   And when it was done<br>
She laid it on the floor<br>
   And wove another one.<br>
She wove a red cloak<br>
   So regal to see,<br>
“Shes made it for a kings son,”<br>
   I said, “and not for me.”<br>
   But I knew it was for me.<br>

<ul>
<li>She wove a little shirt,</li>
<li>She wove a little pair of breeches,</li>
<li>She wove a little jacket,</li><br>
<li>She wove another one,</li><br>    
<li>She wove a pair of breeches</li><br>
<li>Abd a kuttke shirt,</li><br>
Quicker than that!<br>
</ul>
<li>She wove a pair of boots</li><br>
<li>And a little cocked hat</li>.<br>
 
She wove a pair of mittens,<br>
   She wove a little blouse,<br>
She wove all night<br>
   In the still, cold house.<br>
 
She sang as she worked,<br>
   And the <strong>harp strings spoke;</strong><br>
Her voice never faltered,<br>
And the thread never broke.<br>
   And when I awoke,—<br>
 
There sat my mother<br>
   With the <em>harp against her shoulder</em><br>
Looking nineteen<br>
   And not a day older,<br>
 
A smile about her lips,<br>
   And a light about her head,<br>
And her hands in the harp-strings<br>
   Frozen dead.<br>
 
And piled up beside her<br>
   And toppling to the skies,<br>
Were the clothes of a kings son,<br>
   Just my size.<br></p>
